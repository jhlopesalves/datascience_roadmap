# Jhonatan Lopes - My Data Science Roadmap

<div class="hero" markdown>

### About This Roadmap

This is my personal study path in data science.  
I’m not selling a course or pretending to be a guru—this is just me learning, week by week, and documenting the process.

The roadmap mixes the things I care about: **maths**, **machine learning practice**, **LLMs**, and the operational side of making projects reproducible. Everything here is code, versioned, and open for anyone curious to follow along.

---

- 40 weeks, split into 5 phases, with weekly goals
- All content built and hosted with GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages
- Written with MkDocs Material

## Why this roadmap

<div class="feature-grid" markdown>

-   :material-compass-outline: **Structured & instrumented**  
    Weekly briefs, data-driven checklists, and macro-powered pages keep you shipping.

-   :material-lightbulb-on-outline: **Applied first, theory tight**  
    Each sprint blends implementation with the maths that justify it—no cargo culting.

-   :material-shield-check: **Governance baked in**  
    Fairness, monitoring, documentation, and responsible GenAI appear long before launch day.

-   :material-rocket-launch: **Deployment-minded**  
    CI, observability, serving, and cost guardrails turn models into sustainable products.

## How to work the plan

!!! tip "Weekly rhythm"
    1. Review the brief in *Roadmap → Week XX*.  
    2. Clone the matching repo template or notebook starter.  
    3. Ship the project checklist (code, math, reading, documentation).  
    4. Log metrics and reflections—progress is visible history.

> Principle: *Roadmap as code*. Every artefact is trackable, reviewable, and continuously deployable.
