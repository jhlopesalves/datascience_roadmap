# Jhonatan — Data Science Roadmap

Welcome. This is a book‑style roadmap that balances **applied mathematics**, **practical machine learning**, **NLP/LLMs**, and **deployment discipline**.

Use the **Roadmap** section to navigate week by week, the **Resources** to find books and documentation, and **Projects** to track deliverables and metrics.

> Principle: *Roadmap as code*. Everything here is versioned, reproducible, and measurable.
