# Jhonatan — Data Science Roadmap

<div class="hero" markdown>

### A production-grade path from first principles to deployed AI systems

Cut through noise with an opinionated curriculum that balances **math**, **hands-on ML**, **LLMs**, and **operations discipline**. Everything lives as code, versioned and reproducible.

## Why this roadmap

<div class="feature-grid" markdown>

-   :material-compass-outline: **Structured & instrumented**  
    Weekly briefs, data-driven checklists, and macro-powered pages keep you shipping.

-   :material-lightbulb-on-outline: **Applied first, theory tight**  
    Each sprint blends implementation with the maths that justify it—no cargo culting.

-   :material-shield-check: **Governance baked in**  
    Fairness, monitoring, documentation, and responsible GenAI appear long before launch day.

-   :material-rocket-launch: **Deployment-minded**  
    CI, observability, serving, and cost guardrails turn models into sustainable products.

## How to work the plan

!!! tip "Weekly rhythm"
    1. Review the brief in *Roadmap → Week XX*.  
    2. Clone the matching repo template or notebook starter.  
    3. Ship the project checklist (code, math, reading, documentation).  
    4. Log metrics and reflections—progress is visible history.
