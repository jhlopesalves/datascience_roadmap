# Weeks 03–40

Every week already has its own page powered by `{{ render_week(n) }}`. Update the entries in `docs/data/weeks.yaml` as you flesh them out; the pages will refresh automatically.

{{ week_toc() }}

> Weeks 03–40 currently use placeholder copy. Edit the YAML data to publish a full brief for each week.
